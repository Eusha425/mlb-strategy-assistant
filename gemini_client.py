**Situation**:
- Count: {count}
- Runners: {runners}
- Pitch thrown: {pitch_type}

**Task**:
Explain why this pitch was chosen in 1 short sentence. Use a creative analogy from everyday life (e.g., pizza, video games, weather). 

**Rules**:
- No technical terms like "spin rate", "exit velocity", or "WHIP".
- Focus on the pitcher's goal (e.g., strikeout, ground ball).
- Make it relatable and fun!

Example: "The pitcher threw a curveball here â€” like a rollercoaster suddenly dropping, it fools the batter into swinging too early!"""
